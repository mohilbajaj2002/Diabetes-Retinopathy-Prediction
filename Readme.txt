 *** Diabetes Retinopathy (DR) Prediction ***


 This project was a kaggle dataset by the same name. The idea of the project was to identify patients who had a high probability of been diagnosed with DR a few years down the line. The data for this challenge was high quality retinal scans of patients.

Please note that the image file dataset is in excess of 3 GB. Please download it directly from the kaggle website.


This project consists of the following files:

- cnn.py: This is the file that contains the code for the CNN (Convolutional Neural Net) model.

- create_train_data.py: This is the file that was used to generate training data from image files.  

- image_preprocessing.py: This is the file that was used to pre-process image files.

- image_preprocessing_rotation.py: This is the file that was used to rotate image files. This was done to remove any biases related to the orientation of the images from the final model.

- splittingintolabels.py: This is the file that was used to split images into different directories based on their labels.
